### Importance of Robo-Advisor

* What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?

Betterment is a so-called robo-advisor for the retail market. Like all financial advisors for individuals, Betterment manages their investment portfolios, which, in Betterment’s case, consist entirely of exchange traded (mutual) funds or ETF’s. Betterment and other robo-advisors differ from traditional financial advisors, first, in the way the customer interacts with them, and, second, in the way the portfolios are constructed.  
        Their competitors are the traditional advisors. 

**Difference Between Betterment and Traditional Advisor**

Traditional advisor conduct a personal interview to determine the customer’s risk tolerance, the Betterment robo-advisor presents the customer with a series of questions on their website. The robo-advisor’s software would then quantify that risk tolerance and use it to compute an optimal portfolio, constrained by the quantified risk tolerance.

* How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?

    - Traditional advisors, especially advisors working with individuals, do not quantify their customers’ risk tolerance. This prevents them from constructing   portfolio using the theories of quantitative finance, most notably the [Black-Litterman model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/black-litterman_model.asp). However, Betterment does.
